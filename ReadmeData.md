We utilized USDA nutrition dataset

The dataset is not user friendly, therefore we changed it to be a good fit for the context of our work.

There is are columns for food names, their codes in USDA, calorie, ash, fiber, lipid, sugar, and protein values.

The other columns belong to exisiting unit of measurements in the USDA dataset. If there is a value for them in USDA we put the value, otherwise we put null.
