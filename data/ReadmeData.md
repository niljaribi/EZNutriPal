EZNutriPal uses a modified version the USDA nutrition dataset for dietary monitoring.

The USDA dataset has been modified for use in the context of our work.

There are columns for food names, their codes in USDA, calorie, ash, fiber, lipid, sugar, and protein values.

The other columns belong to existing unit of measurements in the USDA dataset. If there is a value for such   columns in the USDA dataset, we replicate the value; otherwise,  we put null.
